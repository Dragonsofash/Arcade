# Arcade
A Collection of Games.
## The Goal
To create a functional collection of games:
    -connect 4
    -mancala
    -snake
    -tic tac toe

#### Connect 4
-Create a grid of user entered columns and rows. Must be at least 4 tall/wide
-Players take turns making moves until someone has won. To win 4 pieces of the same color must be in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
#### Mancala
-Create a board with 2 mancala pots on the far left and right ends, with 12 pots in the middle divided into 2 rows.
-Players take turns selecting pots and adding to their mancalas. If they land on their mancala, they get another turn. If they land on an empty pot, they collect both pots vertically. After all pots are empty, the game is over.
-The player with the most "marbles" wins.
#### Snake
-Create a grid that contains a "snake" and objects to collect.
-The player must survive as long as possible collecting objects, making their "snake" longer. If the player runs into themselves or a border, the game is over.
#### Tic-Tac-Toe
-Create a board of 3 rows and 3 columns.
-Player(s) enter their names. Player 1 goes first.
-Players take turns making moves on the board. Players can only make a move in an empty box.
-If there are 3 of a kind horizontally, vertically, or diagonally the game is over and that corresponding player wins. If the board is full and there are not 3 of a kind, the game ends in a draw.
-Reset the board with a button to play again.
