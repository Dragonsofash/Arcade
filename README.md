MANCALA

    As users playing a two player game we want to:

        enter our names and have them displayed
        have our order chosen for us by the game
        take alternating turns according to the rules
        pick a pit that has pips and is ours on our turn
        have those pips distributed correctly according to the rules of mancala
        capture opponent pips when we end in an empty pit on our side
        take an extra turn when we end in our mancala
        be told when a player wins or if there is a draw once all pips are in mancalas
        start the game over without having to reset the browser

    As a user playing a one player game I want to:

        see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
        have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player, obeying all the rules from the two player game

    As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

        the computer made 'better-than-guessing' choices when choosing a pit for the next move

#### Connect 4
-Create a grid of user entered columns and rows. Must be at least 4 tall/wide
-Players take turns making moves until someone has won. To win 4 pieces of the same color must be in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
#### Mancala
-Create a board with 2 mancala pots on the far left and right ends, with 12 pots in the middle divided into 2 rows.
-Players take turns selecting pots and adding to their mancalas. If they land on their mancala, they get another turn. If they land on an empty pot, they collect both pots vertically. After all pots are empty, the game is over.
-The player with the most "marbles" wins.
#### Snake
-Create a grid that contains a "snake" and objects to collect.
-The player must survive as long as possible collecting objects, making their "snake" longer. If the player runs into themselves or a border, the game is over.
#### Tic-Tac-Toe
-Create a board of 3 rows and 3 columns.
-Player(s) enter their names. Player 1 goes first.
-Players take turns making moves on the board. Players can only make a move in an empty box.
-If there are 3 of a kind horizontally, vertically, or diagonally the game is over and that corresponding player wins. If the board is full and there are not 3 of a kind, the game ends in a draw.
-Reset the board with a button to play again.
